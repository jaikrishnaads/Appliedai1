# Appliedai1

Educational examples demonstrating basic perceptron logic and simple neural network forward/backward propagation implemented in Python and Jupyter Notebook.

## Repository overview

This repository contains small, self-contained experiments that illustrate core concepts in applied AI and neural networks, intended for learning and experimentation.

What you'll find here:

- `ex2andandor.py` - Perceptron implementation demonstrating AND and OR gate behavior, with a simple activation function and training loop.
- `ex3forwardandbackwardpropagation.py` - A Python script that implements forward and backward propagation for a small neural network, including weight and bias updates.
- `Untitled (1).ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook version of the forward/backward propagation experiment (interactive exploration and step-by-step calculations).
- `heart.csv` - A CSV dataset included for experimenting with simple supervised learning exercises (basic heart dataset for demonstration).

## Getting started

Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ recommended
- pip

Install dependencies (example):

```bash
pip install numpy pandas jupyter matplotlib
```

Running the examples

- Run the perceptron AND/OR example:

```bash
python ex2andandor.py
```

- Run the forward/backward propagation script:

```bash
python ex3forwardandbackwardpropagation.py
```

- Open the notebook for interactive exploration:

```bash
jupyter notebook "Untitled (1).ipynb"
```

Notes

- These scripts are educational and intentionally simple to make the underlying math and logic easy to follow.
- Expect straightforward, small-scale examples rather than production-ready models or data preprocessing pipelines.

Dataset

- `heart.csv` is a small CSV file included for experimentation. Ensure any scripts that read it expect it to be located in the repository root or adjust paths accordingly.
